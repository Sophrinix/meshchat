89fb80a2	1455769564	Yeah that is why your message was before mine.	K7FPV	kd7dho-m3	node
137dc646	1455769622	Okay.  Should be fixed now.	N7IE	n7ie-omni-15	node
05b26607	1455769650	I added some new API's to AREDN to make it so I can get the list of nodes that are running meshchat vs polling all the nodes. With a mesh of 100 nodes with spotty connections it would take like 30 mins for messages to propagate.	K7FPV	kd7dho-m3	node
dbf77dfc	1455769692	So now with v0.5 it is WAY faster, but AREDN only. I only want to support it for AREDN only since I can make changes in that code as I need.	K7FPV	kd7dho-m3	node

b0c85609	1455769814	That makes sense, but I was hoping you'd not dump BBHN completely to ensure compatibility between the systems, should that be needed.  Oh well.\n	N7IE	n7ie-omni-15	node
4266bc9e	1455769886	Yeah I was holding out as long as I could to support both but just not feasible anymore with these large networks people run.	K7FPV	laytonwestdistrict	pi
